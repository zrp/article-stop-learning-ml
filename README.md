# Stop Learning ML - Start Building AI Systems

This repository contains three practical AI applications that demonstrate how to build real-world AI systems using modern tools and frameworks. These projects are designed to help you move from theoretical ML concepts to building functional AI applications.

## üìö Article

This repository supports the article: **[Stop Learning ML - Start Building AI Systems](https://techblog.zrp.com.br/p/e3372ba1-caae-414f-8d53-4bd6c778be6e/)**

## üöÄ Projects Overview

### 1. **AI Code Reviewer** 
A code analysis tool that uses GPT-4 to review code for bugs, performance issues, style improvements, and security concerns. Supports multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, and Rust.

**Features:**
- Real-time code analysis with streaming responses
- Multi-language support
- Structured JSON output with detailed feedback
- Security and performance recommendations

### 2. **Document Q&A System**
A conversational AI system that allows you to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. Built with LangChain and FAISS for efficient document processing and retrieval.

**Features:**
- PDF document processing and text extraction
- Intelligent text chunking and embedding
- Conversational chat interface
- Streaming responses for better UX
- Persistent chat history

### 3. **AI Content Moderator**
A content moderation tool that uses Hugging Face's toxic-bert model to detect and flag inappropriate content in real-time.

**Features:**
- Toxicity detection and scoring
- Real-time content analysis
- Configurable blocking thresholds
- Clean, intuitive interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for Code Reviewer and Document Q&A)
- Internet connection (for model downloads)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd document-qa

# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate demo
```

#### Option 2: Using pip
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd document-qa

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

1. **Get your OpenAI API key:**
   - Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key for use in the applications

2. **Set your API key:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

## üéØ Running the Applications

### Code Reviewer
```bash
streamlit run code-reviewer.py
```
- Upload or paste your code
- Select the programming language
- Get instant feedback on bugs, performance, style, and security

### Document Q&A
```bash
streamlit run document-qa.py
```

- Ask questions and get AI-powered answers

### Content Moderator
```bash
streamlit run content-moderator.py
```
- Enter text to check for inappropriate content
- Get toxicity scores and moderation recommendations
- **Note:** First run will download the toxic-bert model (~500MB)
